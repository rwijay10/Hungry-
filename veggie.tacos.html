<p class="vt-r">
1. To make the veggie filling: In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 2 teaspoons olive until shimmering. Add onions and a dash of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and turning translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes, stir, and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the zucchini, yellow squash and bell pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the squash is softened and cooked through but not mushy, about 7 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and squeeze the juice of ½ of a lime over the veggies. Season to taste with salt, stir to combine, then set the pan aside. <br>
<br>2. To scramble the eggs: Scramble the eggs in a bowl with a few dashes of hot sauce, a sprinkling of black pepper and a pinch of salt. Scramble over medium-low heat until the eggs are lightly set. Fold in the tomatoes and transfer the scrambled mixture to a bowl.<br>
<br>3. To prepare the tacos: Warm each corn tortilla in a pan over medium heat, flipping occasionally. Transfer warmed tortillas to a plate and cover with a tea towel to keep them warm. Top each tortilla with scrambled eggs, followed by veggies, and other toppings you want<br>
